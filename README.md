# typescript-notes
- Superset of Javascript
- Offers additional features to JS including static types
- Using types is optional
- Compiles down to vanilla JS
- Can be used in frontend and backend node.js
- Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with type definitions
- Typescript COmpiler (TSC) is used to compile .ts files to .js
- tsconfig.json file is used to configure how Typescript works

# Dynamic vs Static Typing
- In dynamically types languages, the types are associated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code
- In statically typed languages, we explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values etc..
    - Static - Java, C, C++, Rust, GO
    - Dynamic - Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP

# Pros & Cons
- Pros
    - More Robust
    - Easily Spot Bugs
    - Predictability
    - Readability
    - Popular
-Cons
    - More Code to write
    - More to learn
    - Requires Compilation
    - Not true static typing as the code is eventually compiled down to JS

# Installing Typescript
    - npm i typescript
